# LittleMedic Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** February 22, 2026 · Version 1.0

> **Summary:** LittleMedic stores all data *exclusively on your device*. We do not collect, transmit, or share any personal or health information with any server, third party, or developer.

---

## 1. Who We Are

LittleMedic ("the App", "we", "our") is developed and maintained by Stipe Grbić (stipegrbic@hotmail.com). The App is designed to help parents and caregivers track the health of their children, including illnesses, medications, and medical appointments.

## 2. Data We Collect

The App may store the following data that you choose to enter:

- Children's names, birthdates, and profile information
- Illness records (symptoms, dates, notes)
- Medication records (name, dosage, schedule, linked illnesses)
- Medical appointment records (type, date, time, clinic, doctor, notes)
- Medication administration logs

**All of this data is stored locally on your device** using an on-device SQLite database. It is never transmitted to any external server or third party.

## 3. Data We Do NOT Collect

- We do not collect analytics, crash reports, or usage statistics
- We do not use advertising SDKs or tracking libraries
- We do not create accounts or require sign-in
- We do not access your contacts, camera, microphone, or location
- We do not transmit any data over the internet

## 4. Notifications

The App uses on-device scheduled notifications (via the operating system's local notification APIs) to remind you about medication times and upcoming appointments. These notifications are generated entirely on your device. No data is sent to any server to deliver them.

You can enable or disable notifications at any time in the App's Settings → Notifications, or through your device's system settings.

## 5. Data Export and Import

The App provides an optional Backup / Export feature that creates a JSON file containing your data. This file is saved to a location you choose on your device (e.g., Files, iCloud Drive, Google Drive). The App does not upload this file anywhere automatically — you are in full control of where it is saved and shared.

If you choose to store the backup in a cloud service (iCloud, Google Drive, etc.), that service's own privacy policy applies.

## 6. Children's Privacy

LittleMedic is designed to be used *by* parents and caregivers to track information *about* children in their care. The App is not directed at children and does not knowingly collect data from children directly.

Because all data is stored locally on your device and never transmitted, the App complies with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) and similar regulations by design — no personal information about children is ever sent to us or any third party.

## 7. Data Security

Your data is protected by your device's built-in security (screen lock, device encryption). Since we never receive your data, we cannot be subject to a server-side data breach affecting your information.

We recommend keeping your device secured with a passcode or biometric lock and regularly backing up your data using the App's export feature.

## 8. Data Deletion

You can delete individual records (children, illnesses, medications, appointments) at any time from within the App. Uninstalling the App from your device will permanently delete all locally stored data. We have no copy of your data and cannot restore it after uninstallation.

## 9. Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data-collection services.

The App is distributed through the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. These platforms may collect information about app downloads and crashes according to their own privacy policies, which are independent of this App.

## 10. Changes to This Policy

If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will update the effective date above and publish the new version at this URL. Continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## 11. Contact
