FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

────────────────────────────────────────

Is my data private and secure?

All data is stored exclusively on your device using a local database. Nothing is ever sent to any server, cloud service, or third party. Not even the developer can access your data.

How do I add a second child?

Go to the Profile tab and tap "Add child". You can switch the active child at any time using the child selector at the top of the screen.

My notifications are not arriving. What should I check?

Make sure notifications are enabled for LittleMedic in your device's Settings → Notifications. You can also check the notification status inside the app under Profile → Notifications. On Android, ensure battery optimization is not blocking background processes.

How do I back up my data?

Go to Profile → Backup / Export. This creates a JSON file you can save to iCloud Drive, Google Drive, or anywhere on your device. To restore, use Profile → Import / Restore and select the backup file.

What happens to my data if I uninstall the app?

Uninstalling the app permanently deletes all local data. We strongly recommend using the Backup / Export feature before uninstalling. We do not have a copy of your data and cannot restore it.

Can I link a medication to an illness?

Yes. When adding or editing a medication, you can select a linked illness from the list. Linked medications also appear directly on the illness detail screen.

How far in advance are medication reminders scheduled?

For long-term medications, reminders are scheduled 90 days in advance on a rolling basis. For short-term medications, reminders are scheduled through the end date. Reminders are rescheduled automatically when you edit a medication.

The app is in English. Will other languages be supported?

Additional languages are planned for a future update. If you'd like to help translate, please reach out via the contact email below.
