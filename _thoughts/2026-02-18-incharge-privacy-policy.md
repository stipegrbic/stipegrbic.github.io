## 1\. Information We Collect

### Information You Provide

InCharge allows you to create and manage responsibilities, categories, and reminders.  
All content you enter into the app (such as titles, descriptions, and dates) is stored locally on your device.

We do not require account creation.

We do not collect personal identity information such as your name, address, or phone number.

### Subscription Information

If you purchase a subscription or lifetime upgrade, payments are processed securely by Apple App Store or Google Play.

We do not receive or store your payment details.  
We only receive confirmation of your subscription status.

### Analytics (If Applicable)

InCharge may use privacy-friendly analytics tools to understand general usage patterns (such as feature usage or crashes).

This information:

*   Does not personally identify you
    
*   Is used only to improve the app experience
    

If analytics are not used, you can remove this section.

## 2\. How Your Data Is Stored

All responsibility data is stored locally on your device.

If cloud backup or synchronization features are introduced in the future, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly.

We use limited information to:

*   The right to request information about your data
