**\# Privacy Policy for WooHoo**

**Last updated: 2026-02-09**

**Your privacy matters to us. WooHoo helps you track intimate moments securely while respecting your personal data protection.**

**\## Information We Collect**

**We collect two categories of information:**

**1\. Information you provide: Data about your events, including dates, ratings, tags, moods, locations (only if you opt in), and duration**

**2\. Usage data: Anonymous and aggregated data to help improve app performance**

**\## How We Use Your Information**

**We use your information to:**

**\- Provide and improve app features**

**\- Personalize your experience and display relevant insights**

**\- Enable optional features like public leaderboards (with your explicit consent)**

**We never share your personal information with third parties without your consent.**

**\## Public Leaderboards (Optional)**

**WooHoo offers an optional public leaderboards feature that allows you to share your statistics with other users. This feature is completely opt-in and disabled by default.**

**\### What Gets Shared When You Enable Leaderboards**

**If you choose to enable leaderboards, the following aggregated statistics are made PUBLIC and visible to all users:**

**\- Your chosen username (not your real name)**

**\- Total number of events**

**\- Total duration (sum of all events)**

**\- Average rating**

**\- Frequency (events per week)**

**\- Date of first and last event**

**\- Average duration per event**

**\### What NEVER Gets Shared**

**When you use leaderboards, we never share:**

**\- Your personal information (email, name, device info, etc.)**

**\- Individual event details (specific dates, times, notes, moods)**

**\- Locations, tags, or any descriptive information**

**\- Any personally identifiable information**

**\- Raw event data**

**\### How Leaderboards Work**

**\- You must explicitly enable leaderboards in Settings → Leaderboard Settings**

**\- You choose a public username (3-20 characters, alphanumeric and underscores only)**

**\- Your statistics are stored on Firebase Firestore (Google's cloud database service)**

**\- Your data is identified by a unique anonymous user ID**

**\- Statistics automatically update when you add or modify events**

**\- You can change your username or disable leaderboards at any time from Settings**

**\### Disabling Leaderboards**

**You can disable leaderboards at any time from Settings → Leaderboard Settings. Disabling leaderboards will stop future updates to your public statistics. Note that previously uploaded data may remain in the database.**

**\## Data Storage**

**\### Local Storage**

**All your personal event data is stored securely on your device. We do not have access to this data unless you explicitly opt in to features that require cloud storage.**

**\### Cloud Storage (Optional)**

**\- HealthKit Sync (iOS only): If you enable HealthKit integration, event data is synced with Apple Health on your device**

**\- Leaderboards: If you enable leaderboards, aggregated statistics (not individual event details) are stored on Firebase Firestore and made publicly visible to other leaderboard participants**

**\## Your Control**

**You have complete control over your data:**

**\- You can delete your data anytime within the app**

**\- You can enable or disable optional features (HealthKit sync, leaderboards) at any time**

**\- You can export your data for backup purposes**

**\- Leaderboard participation is entirely optional and does not affect core app functionality**

**\## Security**

**We use industry-standard measures to protect your data from unauthorized access. Your local data is stored securely on your device using SQLite encryption where available.**

**\## Third-Party Services**

**When you opt in to leaderboards, we use:**

**\- Firebase Authentication: To generate a unique anonymous user ID**

**\- Firebase Firestore: To store and retrieve public leaderboard statistics**

**\- Firebase Crashlytics: To collect anonymous crash reports for improving app stability**

**These services are provided by Google and are subject to \[Google's Privacy Policy\](**[**https://policies.google.com/privacy**](https://policies.google.com/privacy)**).**

**\## Children's Privacy**

**WooHoo is intended for users 18 years of age and older. We do not knowingly collect information from anyone under 18.**

**\## Changes to This Policy**

**We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.**

**\## Contact Us**

**If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy or your data, please contact us at:**
