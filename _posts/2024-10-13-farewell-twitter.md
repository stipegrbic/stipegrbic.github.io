Ok, the time has come for me to stop using twitter. It’s been long time live or die relationship, but these days a sad thing happened that triggered me to do kill it.

I’ve never liked social networks that much, I’m just not into exposing my personal life that much. That’s why I opened my twitter account relatively late, in 2012 when everyone was on Facebook anyway. I wanted a small, not bloated (remember games on facebook?) social network that doesn’t try to live your life for you, but a place where I could get a lot of short and fast information and also share some interesting thoughts.

It worked relatively well for me, I found a short circle of interesting people to follow and also shared my thoughts here and there. It never was that important to me anyway, but I grew a habit of scrolling through it daily. Years were passing by and my feeling was always like twitter never took advantage of its potential. I was hoping it will start gaining popularity and will get better. Then after Elon Musk bought it I knew it’s now or never. It will grow into something more, or just finally die. Unfortunately, it didn’t get any better, in a lot of ways it got worse and for me it’s now dead.

The trigger that caused me to start migration from the platform was Elon Musk’s involvement in Trump’s presidential campaign. I finally admit to myself he’s a liar and shady man, not at all a genius we were all told he is. Not to mention his anti semitic posts and involvement in war in Ukraine. I can no longer be a member and contribute to his every day business even with my one twitter profile.

I said migration, so where I’d migrate with my random thoughts I want to share with the world? Instagram or Threads are not exactly what I’m looking for. Plus, I don’t need an ecosystem filled with ads, bots and influencers. What I need is just a place on the yinternet where I can share my thoughts with the world. I don’t care that much about how many people I can reach, I’m writing mostly for my future self. Reach I was getting on twitter wasn’t any better at all, less than 10 views per post is not worth giving ownership of my content to someone else. So I figured I’ll write my thoughts or posts if you like it here on my own web site. But not in form of a post like this, I’ve built a separate section called “thoughts” that will serve my needs to share my short thought or interesting fscts from my life. I’m currently in the process of migrating most of my twitter posts here into my thoughts. After that’s done I’ll finally close my twitter account, like Musk wrote it “bid adieu to the twitter”.
