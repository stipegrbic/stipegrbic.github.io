It’s been almost two months that I got a Mac for my work. Some things are great, like battery, display and build quality. But some of the things I still can’t accept.

For instance, I had to to basic calculations and wanted to have multiole calculator app instances. Guess what, there’s no easy way to get that. After sesrching the web I found out I need a terminal for that.

Why? I don’t know, to me it looks like Apple doesn’t bother with some of the details like this, as long as terminal can do the job and users are used to it, it’s fine. I will hardly ever get used to this and for sure next time will have to search the web again and spend at least a minute to get another app instance running.
